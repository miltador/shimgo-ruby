== About

Provides a simple API written in `sinatra` for converting `asciidoctor` into HTML.

=== API

* *GET /* - status information

* *GET /support/:format* - returns 'supported\n' if format is supported
+
Supported formats:
+
** asciidoctor

* *POST /asciidoctor* - expects the body to be a `asciidoctor` content
to be converted into HTML. Returns JSON object with the following properties:
** _info_ - empty if no errors, else - string with errors
** _content_ - converted output

=== Thanks

* @tychoish for providing his initial Python API that was replicated by me in Ruby
